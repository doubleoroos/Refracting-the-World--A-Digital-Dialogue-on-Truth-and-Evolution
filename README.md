## 📸 Project Overview

**Refracting the World** is an immersive, interactive web platform designed to interrogate the evolution of photography over the last 200 years. Built as a digital proposal for the Bicentennial label, the site explores the tension between "Reference Reality" (documentary truth) and "Artistic Truth" (interpretation) in the age of AI.

This project features a high-end **Cinematic UI** with glassmorphism effects, film grain textures, and integrated **Generative AI** tools to prototype the future of the medium.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏛 Interactive Pillars
- **Pillar A (Perception Slider):** A custom-built comparison tool with a technical "HUD" interface allowing users to slide between raw documentary footage and artistic interpretation. Includes AI-powered context analysis.
- **Pillar B (The Process Layer):** An interactive 3D-transforming component that "explodes" an image into its constituent layers: Physics/Light, Digital Darkroom, and Final Output.
- **Pillar C (Learning Hub):** An educational module with AI-generated curriculum explanations connecting historical techniques (Camera Obscura) to modern AI.

### 🤖 Generative AI Integration (Google Gemini)
The platform leverages the `@google/genai` SDK to offer real-time generative experiences:
- **Context Analysis:** Gemini 2.5 Flash analyzes the philosophy behind the "Utopia of Accuracy".
- **The Digital Atelier:**
  - **Imagen 3:** Generates thematic concept art based on user prompts.
  - **Veo:** Generates cinematic video montages for strategic roadmaps.
  - **Auto-Summarization:** Synthesizes the project manifesto into an executive summary.

### 🎨 UI/UX Design System
- **Cinematic Minimalism:** Dark mode aesthetic (`#0a0a0a`) with global noise overlay and ambient gradient blobs.
- **Glassmorphism:** Advanced frosted glass effects (`backdrop-blur-xl`) with subtle borders and lighting.
- **Accessibility:** Fully WCAG 2.1 compliant with visible focus states, semantic HTML, and ARIA labels.
- **Bilingual Support:** Full English (EN) and French (FR) localization.
- **PDF Generation:** One-click functionality to download the entire site as a dossier.

- **Framework:** React 19
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN for portability)
